Project Title
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

I've created a multiplayer pixel fighting game with the following features:

Game Features:
Room Code System: Create or join rooms with 6-character codes
Two-Player Local Multiplayer: Both players can play on the same device
Fighting Mechanics: Punch and kick attacks with combo system
Health System: 100 HP with visual health bars
Retro Pixel Graphics: Simple, colorful pixel art style
Controls:
Player 1 (Red):

A/D: Move left/right
W: Jump
S: Crouch
Space: Attack (single tap = punch, double tap = kick)
Player 2 (Blue):

Arrow Keys: Move and jump
Down Arrow: Crouch
Enter: Attack (single tap = punch, double tap = kick)
Game Mechanics:
Combat: Players can punch (15 damage) or kick (25 damage)
Movement: Full 2D movement with jumping and crouching
Collision Detection: Attacks only hit when players are in range
Win Condition: First player to reduce opponent's health to 0 wins
Additional Features:
Click-to-attack support for both players
Real-time health bars
Winner announcement
Restart functionality (press R)
Responsive pixel art rendering
The game simulates multiplayer with room codes and could easily be extended with a backend for true online multiplayer. Players can create rooms, share codes, and battle it out in classic fighting game style!
